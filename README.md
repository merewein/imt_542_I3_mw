## Overview
This code pulls from the Seattle Pet License database, which includes pet license information for all registered pets in the greater Seattle area, noting their names, species, breed, and the zip code in which they live.

The information visualized is a compilation of the 10 most common names for pets in the Seattle area, with differentiation between the number of animals of a certain species with that name.

## Instructions
The repository contains a Python Notebook file that can be opened in Google Colab. Download the file and import into Colab, copy and paste the code, or click the link when you view the file in Github that says 'open in Colab'.

The csv file containing the data is in the repository, but can also be downloaded at https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/seattle-pet-licenses-f092d
